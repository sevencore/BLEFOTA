# BLEFOTA
Bluetooth Low Energy based FOTA solution

BLE FOTA project is Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE, Bluetooth Smart) based FOTA(Firmware Over The Air) solution for IoT and etc. devices.

This solution helps to manage a variety of devices in a batch by using smart devices as a gateway and the server as a firmware management.
Because many IoT devices and small-things use BLE and etc. which are low-power, short range wireless communication technology.
There are three principal reasons that the BLE FOTA solution is useful. First, devices are possible to perform continuous firmware update on the side of performance and security. Second, arrangement environment and product types of devices cause the difficulty of firmware management. Third, it is difficult to manage a variety of devices in a batch. BLE FOTA solution is composed of BLE based device, smart device and remote server. And so the devices are able to do FOTA by omnipresent smart devices and be managed by remote server, and besides heterogeneous devices can be an applicable object of BLE FOTA solution by BLE FOTA profile.

In this project, we present the android library project and profile specification as an open source.
